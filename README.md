Normal consolidated line -> as the effective stress increases the void decreases    
Over consolidated line -> as the preconsolidation ratio divided by the initial stress.

## Sources of stress in the ground

1. Geostatic Stress -> Due to weight of soil above and around; natural occurring; Affected by geologic and human action
2. Induced Stresses -> Caused by external loads on ground surface (building foundation, water tank, vehicle)
